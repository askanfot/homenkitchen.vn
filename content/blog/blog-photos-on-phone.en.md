Dalat Train Station – A proud history
Dalat Train Station is 5 kilometers away from the heart of the city. It is a place that you cannot miss when visiting this flowery city. This construction is near Yersin High School, on a long and flat hillside. French built this station. Since 1908, they planned a railway construction that went from Thap Cham to Dalat. It was built in 1932 and finished in 1938. The creators of this masterpiece were French architects, Moncet and Reveron. The total cost spent was up to 200.000 franc – a big number at that time.

But when this train station appeared, an influx of tourists increases per year. When Frech government left Vietnam, left Dalat, this place was still under maintenance. Till 1972, it was temporarily closed due to the damage of the war. A few years later, Dalat Train Station was recovered to celebrate Uncle Ho’s birthday.

A picturesque thing of this place is that it is inspired by the magnificent Langbiang. 3 sharp summits symbolize the highest peaks in the area. The overhanging part from the peak and straight retracting part somehow resemble the French Southern train station.

At that time, when constructing Dalat train station, workers used railways and sawtooth engine. It was considered the most unique construction back then. The railway route Dalat – Phan Rang had many mountain underpasses built. That was why it had a carriage behind used for pushing. As a result, building this railway is a rigorous process with 2-3 times higher expense. Unfortunately, the old sawtooth engine is not here anymore.

Nowadays, this train station is not used for logistic purpose anymore. It is served for tourism. The railway is shortened to 7 kilometers, convenient to explore a part of the city. The train runs a 20-minute outward journey and a 20-minute return journey. Tourists have a 30-minute stop at Ve Chai Pagoda for sightseeing. The ticket for this train experience costs around 108.000 – 150.000VNĐ/per.

A good news is that there is a planning project of recovering the old Phan Rang – Da Lat route. If it was completed soon, you could experience not just a 7-kilometer journey, but a 84-kilometer one. The train would go across mountain pass, Pha River’s pass. This is a great news that every Dalat-lovers are looking forward to.
